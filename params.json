In order to run this program on your own device (Mac and PC compatible), you must have the latest version of the computation programming language R downloaded. You can find the latest version here: <a href=\"https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/\">Download and Install R - University of Tennessee Mirror</a>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, you will need the latest version of RStudio which you can find here: <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/\">Download RStudio Desktop</a>.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h3>Running the Langmuir Sorption Modeler on your Mac or PC</h3>\r\nOnce your aforementioned downloads are complete and installed, to run the app on your computer, simply open RStudio. Then select File -> File Open and navigate to the Zip file you downloaded earlier. After extracting those files, select the file \"Langmuir_Shiny_App.R\". RStudio will open the program file which you can then run locally on your computer by clicking the green \"Run App\" button which should launch the interactive Langmuir Sorption Modeler app.  \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>App Guide:</h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>NOTE:</b> The web app may only be used for 25 active hours/mo as a condition of the free hosting and security service  provided by RStudio. So when not using the app, please close your browser tab in order to maximize app usage. If you require the Langmuir Sorption Modeler App for more than 25 active hours/mo, or the hour limit has already been reached for this month - please consider downloading and using the app locally as described above. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intention of this web app is to facilitate the fitting of sorption data to the <b>Langmuir Equation</b>: \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Re=&space;\\frac{k\\cdot&space;Qmax&space;\\cdot&space;Xf}{1&plus;k&space;\\cdot&space;Xf}\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Re=&space;\\frac{k\\cdot&space;Qmax&space;\\cdot&space;Xf}{1&plus;k&space;\\cdot&space;Xf}\" title=\"Re= \\frac{k\\cdot Qmax \\cdot Xf}{1+k \\cdot Xf}\" /></a></div>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Where</b><ul> \r\n<li> <i>RE</i>   is the amount of molecule or ion (S, sorptive) adsorbed or desorbed (mg S/ kg soil)</li> \r\n<li> <i>Xf</i>   is the final measured equilibrium solution concentration (mg S / L soln)</li> \r\n<li> <i>Qmax</i>   is the maximum sorption capacity (mg S / kg soil)</li>\r\n<li> <i>K</i>   is the binding affinity coefficient (L / mg)</li>\r\n(Mayes et al. 2012)</ul>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nTo try out an example of the app functionality, click the Example Sorption Data box. This will load an example dataset of Phosphorus sorption onto soil particles of an Ultisol from collected from Tennessee. \r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/vepfhgljlb221kn/Screen%20Shot%202016-07-11%20at%201.png?dl=0\" alt=\"IMAGE 1\" style=\"width:64px;height:64px;\">\r\n\r\nYou can upload your own sorption data by selecting the Choose File input. <b>Maximum file size 5MB</b>. \r\n<br><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Be sure to signify if your data has headers. The default is Headers = FALSE. \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/l8zlgn27u4uq71m/Screen%20Shot%202016-07-11%20at%202.png?dl=0\" alt=\"IMAGE 2\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter uploading your sorption data, or electing to use the example data, a plot of the molecule or ion sorbed to the sorbent (solid surface) versus the equilibrium concentration of the molecule or ion remaining in solution will be generated. Also displayed below the plot will be outputs of the sorption parameters: Maximum Sorption, the Binding Coefficient, and the Goodness of Fit statistic.<br>\r\n<br> \r\nFeel free to change the plot title, and axis labels as necessary to reflect your data. You can even adjust the y-axis limits with the slider option below the plot if the default limits are not adequate. Also you may download a PNG of your plot by clicking the Download button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/9yeu4ptp606mi3i/Screen%20Shot%202016-07-11%20at%202.28.02%20PM.png?dl=0\" alt=\"IMAGE 3\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br> You may then select between 5 additional tab panels that provide you with various information.\r\n  <h3>Tab Panels:</h3>\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Residuals of Fit<ul>\r\n    <br> This tab presents the user with a plot of the residuals of the fit of their sorption data to the Langmuir equation i.e. how well does the curve fit the observed data. This is useful for illustrating which data points are ill-conforming.\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br><b>NOTE:</b> Do your residuals resemble a \"fan-shape\"?\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br><img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/pqirmjti49ywk30/Screen%20Shot%202016-07-11%20at%204.png?dl=0\" alt=\"IMAGE 3\" style=\"width:128px;height:128px;\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>If so, you may want to consider a log-transformation of your dependent variables. This can be done by returning to the \"plot-tab\" and selecting the \"log-transform\" checkbox underneath your original plot. \r\n    <br>\r\n    <br>To learn more about this technique please visit the National Institute of Standards and Technology <a href=\"http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pri/section2/pri24.htm\">Engineering and Statistics Handbook</a>.\r\n      </ul></li>\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <li>Data<ul>\r\n    <br> A reactive table of the user uploaded data.
